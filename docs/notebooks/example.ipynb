    "# E2E Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the data ingestion, feature engineering, and scoring pipeline for a fixed-income fund recommendation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This illustrates the steps in our pipeline and explains the recommendation method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Highlights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interpretable and flexible knowledge-based recommendation system.\n",
    "- Config-driven pipeline from YAML\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Our proposed recommendation system method is quite simple, it is a knowledge-based recommendation system that relies on CVM data to recommend fixed income funds on a periodic basis. It is designed to run in batch in a monthly basis but also allow exploration and backfill.\n",
    "\n",
    "The high-level recommendation method is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fetches recent data from CVM**. It currently support CDA, but can easily expanded to other data sources, such as AMBIMA, and other CVM data, like daily information about quote values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**: It has a built-in feature engine (quite cool by the way), which allow us to compute flexible feature definitions on parametrized entities and time columns. So, basically, we are currently applying the feature definitions on `(CNPJ_FUNDO_CLASSE, DENOM_SOCIAL)` as entity but we can replace it by any other entity we like.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature definitions are config-driven and are not tied to any specific backend. For example, we are currently using pandas to perform the transformations, but we could easily switch to pyspark, SQL or any other backend we like.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compute Scores**: On top of our features, we compute scores. Each score represent a criteria of interest, for example risk, diversification, etc. Right now, we are using single feature models based on z-score, but we could have more interesting heuristic logics or even ML models at this step. Something that I would like to test but I didn't have the time, is creating a estimated sharpe score, so take the quotas information, train an xgboost to predict the sharpe ration of a fund in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ranking based on Customer Profile Weighting over the Scores**: This is the hearth of our recommendation system. Basically, I perform a weighted sum on top of the scores to compute a final score, which I use to rank the funds. In a sense, it is like a utility function that combines all criteria of interests, aka the scores, into a utility score that best suits a customer profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sense, we apply a **weighted sum** over all criteria, where each weight reflects the customer’s profile as the formula below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```math\n",
    "U_i = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} w_k \\, s_{i,k}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\(U_i\\)** — final utility score for fund *i*  \n",
    "- **\\(s_{i,k}\\)** — score *k* for fund *i*  \n",
    "- **\\(w_k\\)** — weight of score *k* derived from customer profile  \n",
    "- **\\(K\\)** — number of criteria  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "```math\n",
    "U_i =\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "w_1 & w_2 & \\cdots & w_K\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "s_{i,1} \\\\\n",
    "s_{i,2} \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots \\\\\n",
    "s_{i,K}\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "And, we apply normalization:\n",
    "\n",
    "```math\n",
    "U_i = \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \n",
    "\\left( \\frac{w_k}{\\sum_{j=1}^{K} w_j} \\right) s_{i,k}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```math\n",
    "\\text{RankedFunds} = \\operatorname{argsort}\\left( -U_i \\right)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\(U_i\\) is the final utility score for fund *i*\n",
    "- `argsort` returns the indices of funds sorted by the given value\n",
    "- The negative sign ensures **descending order** (highest score first)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Customer Profiles\n",
    "\n",
    "The customer profiles weights, as it is, are hardcoded values. But we propose different ways to define these weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address cold-start, we could have a questionnaire with Likert-scale questions, 1 to 5, to understand how important each criteria is to the customer, or even having a fuzzy logic heuristic to combine the questionnaire answers into the weights for each score.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we have customer feedback on the recommendations, we could introduce this feedback into a re-ranker approach, where we adjust the rankings based on previous choices of our customer portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:** Python packages: `pandas`, `requests`, `pyyaml`. Optional: `pyarrow` or `fastparquet` for Parquet I/O.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: For quick demos this notebook may use local CSV fallbacks; substitute `fetch_manifest(...)` to run the full end-to-end pipeline against remote sources."
